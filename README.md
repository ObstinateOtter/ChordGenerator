# ChordGenerator

**ChordGenerator** is a tool that takes the root note of a musical scale, identifies all the notes within that key, and generates a list of chords that fit perfectly within the scale.

Currently, the program supports generating the following chord types from any given scale:

- Major  
- Minor  
- Diminished  
- Major 7th (maj7)  
- Minor 7th (min7)  
- Suspended 2nd (sus2)  
- Suspended 4th (sus4)

*More chord types will be added soon!*
